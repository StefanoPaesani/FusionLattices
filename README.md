# Fusion Lattices: Code for "High-threshold quantum computing by fusing one-dimensional cluster states" 

This repository contains the source code used to generate and benchmark lattices and fusion lattices in the paper "High-threshold quantum computing by fusing one-dimensional cluster states" by Stefano Paesani and Benjamin J. Brown (preprint available at arXiv:2212.06775).

The code allows for the generation and analysis of a variety of lattices and fusion lattices relevant to measurement-based fault-tolerant quantum computations, including the Raussendorf lattice and its fusion-based constructions via 6-qubit hexagons and 4-qubit GHZ-like resource states from Bartolucci et al. (preprint available at arXiv:2101.09310), as well as the foliated floquet color code (FFCC) lattice and its fusion-based construction with chains and branched chains of different lengths.

The code has been developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS). It should also run on Windows, though with slower performance.

A walk-through of the different functionalities is described in the example notebooks.
